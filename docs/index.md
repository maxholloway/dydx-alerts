# dYdX Alerts Technical Documentation

## What is dYdX Alerts?
dYdX alerts is a free, noncustodial tool for you to get alerts before your dYdX position is liquidated. All software is [open source](https://github.com/maxholloway/dydx-alerts), and the alert bot runs on users' systems (rather than on a centralized platform). This requires that users run their own bot, for which we recommend using a cloud service provider. The bot requires negligible system resources and can be run using a free-tier on most cloud platforms; we recommend using DigitalOcean's $100 of free credit on their free tier ([link](https://try.digitalocean.com/freetrialoffer/)), which will give you up to 20 months of free usage for the bot if you select the smallest droplet size.

## Quick Start
If you want to run your own dYdX alert bot, follow the "Run from Docker" instructions in the [usage guide](usage.md). You can also watch a video guide for setting up the alerts bot by following along [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDOwkrVF_nTZ60vUxIFbNoLTnW8APfQrW).
